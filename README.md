If you are a developer or a tester

- build this program and study it's execution and/or the source code
- answer the following questions:
    - what is this program doing?
    - what rules does it appear to follow?
    - what rules could be changed without changing the source code, only via change made to the input?

If you are not a developer or a tester

- use a LLM or any other IA powered tool, giving it a trace of execution result and/or the source code

- have the IA tool answer the following questions:
    - what is this program doing?
    - what rules does it appear to follow?
    - what rules could be changed without changing the source code, only via change made to the input?

Compare results

    - what information or knowledge did you manage to acquire about the program?
    - was the IA tool able to provide reliable answers to the questions ?
    - how much faster was the IA powered approach compared to the dev/tester approach ?
